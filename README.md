# My First Web Page

> In this repository you'll find **My First Web Page**. This has been the first thing I've ever created with HTML and CSS. I had to say I've really enjoyed making this website, never before I've been involved with the front-end and I have to say it pleasantly surprised me. I've felt for the first time that I've found a way to express my creativity and have the chance to create content. It's like if I found a new world with so much to offer.

## Motivation

My biggest motivation for this project was create a web page that could satisfy me, get knowledge about the concept of front-end, experiment with the new technologies and learn new concepts. I've never thought I was going to enjoy that much, but I just love the fact to have the chance to completely make whatever you could fancy. This is a feeling I love so much, it feels like an absolute freedom. I should say too that I'm really glad that our teacher leave us to choose the theme of the Web Page while the this one have the minimum requirements. I've focused mine around my photography and my girlfriend. I just wanted to show what I'm able to do and how much I've been learning in this short period of time, still surprising me how cool and interesting looks everything. I know is not the best you'll see, but it's just to get an idea of what we're doing and which one could be my actual level. I hope you'll enjoy this page as much as I enjoyed making it.

## Reflections

For this project we had to do a simple web page that must to contain two links to other pages apart from the Index and you had to include, images, videos, music, etc. That was all, quite easy to be honest, don't you think? I've chased with what I was feeling more comfortable to do and about the content I already knew and it likes me like the seventh art, the photography, music... How was my first big Web deployment I was a bit nervous, but after some research on the internet I've found so much information and really big and friendly community, after this I was ready to start to make my first Web Page, I remember it kept me working for a bit less than a week and this was what I got to do. Like always happen to everyone, I would love having more time to make some improvements and fix some details. I've been able to see that like with everything you do, if you invest a bigger amount of time you get a bigger amount of goals, but I don't know if will be just my opinion or more people will be agreed, especially when you're working with the styles (CSS).

The main point of this project is that never before I had to do anything related with the front-end and after this project I think I just got so engaged with this world, I really like it and I saw that I have so much to learn yet. I just which have more free time to keep myself working on new projects and try to develop a really clean and simple Web Page how I saw is the trend today. I'm satisfied because the concepts start to be clear in my mind, I've worked on the back-end and front-end projects now I just fancy so much to be able to make an API REST to be able to make an interaction between them, how cool could be that, do you ever imagine it ?

I hope you'll enjoy scrolling the gallery of the web page and luckily you will even like the photos, maybe you think it's a bit corny but this is because the Web Page is dedicated to her. Love you all !
